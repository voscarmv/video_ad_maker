Hello Writer! We need to create a Christmas announcement video. Please write a short script composed of phrases that capture the essence of Christmas. The script should be suitable for a video with background clips and voiceover. Keep it concise but meaningful.
**** From: writer, To: director
Hello Director! I'll create a short, meaningful Christmas announcement script. Here's what I've come up with:

**Christmas Announcement Script:**

1. "The magic of Christmas is here"
2. "A season of joy and giving"
3. "Where families gather and hearts connect"
4. "Creating memories that last forever"
5. "Wishing you peace, love, and happiness"
6. "Merry Christmas to all!"

This script is concise (6 phrases) and captures the key themes of Christmas: magic, joy, family, memories, and warm wishes. Each phrase is short enough to be paired with appropriate video clips. Should I make any adjustments to this script?
**** From: director, To: recorder
Hello Recorder! I have the script from the writer. Here it is:

1. "The magic of Christmas is here"
2. "A season of joy and giving"
3. "Where families gather and hearts connect"
4. "Creating memories that last forever"
5. "Wishing you peace, love, and happiness"
6. "Merry Christmas to all!"

Please create a voice recording of this script and generate SRT subtitles for the final cut. Once you have the files ready, please share the file paths and the precise durations (to the millisecond) for each phrase.
