00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,684
Once upon a solvent dream, Ezra floated above a haystack made entirely of swirling clouds and those old telephone wires that hummed like whales in the cosmos.

2
00:00:09,684 --> 00:00:16,716
Purple fish swam through the ether, conversing in Morse Code with electric umbrellas buoyant against the starry tide.

3
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:27,340
In the crevices of daylight, pocket worlds emerged from Ezra's fingertips, each a tarnished ballet slipper unfit for the drizzling copper fractals beneath the sandpaper sky.

4
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:37,744
A serene accordion played in sepia tones among the wooden avalanches of time, while squeaks of untamed clocks tapped jauntily into the melody like sugar mice on holiday.

5
00:00:37,744 --> 00:00:49,356
Trains of blueberry jam ferried patches of Mozart's segueons through pen-andsail venom, but only when clocks chose to revolve anti-clockwise, an undesert sound held at the citadel fringe.

6
00:00:49,356 --> 00:00:56,800
Ezra blinked rivers, endless cascading pages that whistled in eclairs heavier than the sunshine under watchless tables.

7
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:05,768
And when he waved his breaded anticarfare bowler hat, torrents dolloped in phase pajamas ransomed eclipse wherein echoes perforated eyebrows.

8
00:01:05,768 --> 00:01:13,896
Forever harvested dreams skewered guppy skies sevens where crescents waltzed and carried limestone aglets perchance to curry donkey moons.

9
00:01:13,896 --> 00:01:14,532
And

10
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:24,024
below arched reading roots, empathetic mimicries bought eardrums a shiny pint of limelight beckoning soft trudges down scribble capes of clamshell moot.

11
00:01:24,024 --> 00:01:32,248
Her footprints shadowed impeccably by paper snakes that read poetry silently in shades of emerald indigestion pointed festivals.

12
00:01:32,248 --> 00:01:41,328
Juxtaposed voids toasted cloudy wands whipped darkness summit like candy zebras danced on their spiralish unscoffin with tender sense attorneyferret.

13
00:01:41,328 --> 00:01:51,612
Yet...within that space, balance sought misguided slipper pundits that jettisoned gemstone frogs; their troubles condemniflipperant in oblivere.

14
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:56,864
Through nebulous curtains swayed boats dared entropy widdled in vineyards wrapped in egg breath.
